# WindFlow (version 1.0)
WindFlow is a C++17 library for parallel data stream processing applications targeting heterogeneous shared-memory architectures featuring multi-core CPUs and GPUs. The library provides common stream processing operators like map, flatmap, filter, fold/reduce as well as sliding-window processing patterns with complex parallel features. Applications are organized through the <b>Multi-Pipe</b> programming construct used to build parallel pipelines interleaved with shuffled connections.

The web site of the library, with a full description of the API and of the run-time system, is available here.
